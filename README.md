# Neural-Network

Neural Network with one hidden layer:
- For the hidden layer 8 neurons
- Sigmoid activation function is used for hidden layer
- The output of the NN is a scalar


Dataset:
- The label for digit 4 is 1, and 0 for 9
- 512 training images (256 images for each digit)
- 128 testing images (64 images for each digit)

Use SGD to minimize the training loss J_train(Î¸)
Neural Network with 8,4 and 12 neurons
